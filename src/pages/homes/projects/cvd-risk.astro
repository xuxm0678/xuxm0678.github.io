          Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Wearable and Behavioral Data

          This project develops a <strong>wearable-driven cardiovascular risk scoring system</strong>
          using statistical and machine learning methods. By combining physiological, behavioral,
          and health indicators, it aims to enhance early identification of at-risk individuals
          and demonstrate interpretable AI for health applications.

        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the world’s leading cause of death.
          Traditional risk models such as Framingham or ASCVD rely on static clinical measures
          like blood pressure and cholesterol, which often overlook real-time lifestyle and behavioral patterns.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          In contrast, wearable devices continuously track metrics like <strong>resting heart rate,
          sleep efficiency, activity level,</strong> and <strong>sedentary behavior</strong>.
          These signals capture physiological stress and daily habits, offering new opportunities
          for dynamic risk prediction and digital health monitoring.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Objective</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          To build a reproducible pipeline that integrates wearable and behavioral features
          to estimate individual cardiovascular risk and visualize model interpretability
          using <strong>SHAP-style feature attributions</strong>.

      <!-- Methods -->

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Methods</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li><strong>Data Inputs:</strong> Derived from wearable signals and survey-based variables,
            including resting heart rate, sleep efficiency, physical activity, substance/alcohol use,
            BMI, hypertension, and diabetes status.</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A composite cardiovascular risk index approximating disease burden,
            weighted by literature-based clinical severity (e.g., congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension).</li>
          <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Baseline linear regression and an optimized
            <strong>XGBoost</strong> model to capture nonlinearity and interactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Validation:</strong> 5×3 repeated cross-validation with R² ≈ 0.63 and RMSE ≈ 0.058,
            indicating good generalizability.</li>
          <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> SHAP values were computed to decompose individual predictions
            into variable-level contributions.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Results -->
      <section id="results" class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Key Findings</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Behavioral and physiological factors such as <strong>alcohol/drug use, BMI, and age</strong>
          were strong positive risk contributors, while <strong>sleep efficiency and physical activity</strong>
          reduced estimated risk. These results emphasize the potential of wearable-based monitoring
          for preventive cardiovascular care and personalized health analytics.
